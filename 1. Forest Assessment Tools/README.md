##Forest Assessment Tools
The Forest Assessment Tools published here are designed to run in Google Earth Engine. 
They are an ML based method for generating continuous surface predictions of Canopy cover, Canopy Height and Aboveground Biomass Density for a given temporal period. 

The RandomForest classifier is trained using GEDI data as labels, with Sentinel 1 SAR, Sentinel 2 and elevation data as inputs.

This Repo contains two files:
1. the script for use in Earth Engine
2. A case study showcasing the use of the script in generating forest cover maps for use in forest inventory planning or forest cover benchmark maps.
