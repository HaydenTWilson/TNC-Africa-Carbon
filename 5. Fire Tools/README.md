# Fire Assessment Tools

The Fire Assessment Tools published here are designed to run in Google Earth Engine. 
The script consists of an analysis workflow for deriving high resolution estimates of the Day of year that a fire occured as well as additional metrics for fire frequency, time since last fire and area burned in the late dry season or early dry season. 

This Repo contains two files:
1. The script for use in Earth Engine (Fire_assessment.js)
2. A case study showcasing the use of the script in generating fire data for use in developing fire management plans.
