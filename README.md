# The Nature Conservancy - Africa Carbon Markets - Spatial Data Analysis Script Repository
Welcome to the AFCC spatial data analysis script repo!

This repository houses the various scripts that have been developed by the TNC Africa Carbon Markets technical team to support the development of carbon projects throughout Africa.

The scripts have been designed to provide decision ready data in support of Carbon project design and implementation and can be broadly classed into the following groups:

## 1. Forest Assessment Tools 
Tools for assessing changes in:
1. AboveGround Woody Biomass Stocks
2. Canopy Height
3. Canopy Cover

## 2. Forest Inventory Tools
Tools for planning and assessing forest inventories.

## 3. ARR Tools
Tools designed to assist with the establishment of project and control plots, develop the performance benchmark for VM0047 projects

## 4. REDD+ Tools
Tools designed to asssist with the development of:
1. Forest Cover Benchmark maps
2. Deforestation Risk models.

## 5. Fire tools
Tools for characterising the fire histories and deriving metrics for calculating project performance in fire managment. 

## 6. Case Studies
The implementation of these tools are then showcased in the case studies folder, where detailed write ups of how the tools have been implemented within the context of actual TNC supported carbon projects throughout africa.
